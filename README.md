# Finance Analytics

The Finance Analytics package is intended to be an open source, easily modifiable and configurable framework for relatively plug-and-play processing of personal finance data.

### Intended features include:
- User identifies a folder/hierarchy containing many bank statements
- Package determines completeness of dataset (duplicates, missing gaps in statements)
- Package converts all statement pdfs to tabular form
- Package can go on to perform general finance analytics using some out-of-the-box options (or user can perform own analytics easily at this point forward)

Listing of currently supported Bank-Products:
- RBC-Chequing
- RBC-Visa
